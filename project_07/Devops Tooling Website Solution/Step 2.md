# STEP 2 — CONFIGURE THE DATABASE SERVER
By now you should know how to install and configure a MySQL DBMS to work with remote Web Server

1. Install MySQL server
2. Create a database and name it tooling
3. Create a database user and name it webaccess
4. Grant permission to webaccess user on tooling database to do anything only from the webservers subnet cidr


## Step 3 — Prepare the Web Servers
We need to make sure that our Web Servers can serve the same content from shared storage solutions, in our case – NFS Server and MySQL 
database.

You already know that one DB can be accessed for reads and writes by multiple clients. For storing shared files that our Web Servers 
will use – we will utilize NFS and mount previously created Logical Volume lv-apps to the folder where Apache stores files to be served 
to the users (/var/www).

This approach will make our Web Servers stateless, which means we will be able to add new ones or remove them whenever we need, and 
the integrity of the data (in the database and on NFS) will be preserved.

## During the next steps we will do following:

- Configure NFS client (this step must be done on all three servers)
- Deploy a Tooling application to our Web Servers into a shared NFS folder
- Configure the Web Servers to work with a single MySQL database


1. Launch a new EC2 instance with RHEL 8 Operating System

2. Install NFS client

```
sudo yum install nfs-utils nfs4-acl-tools -y
```

3. Mount /var/www/ and target the NFS server’s export for apps

```
sudo mkdir /var/www
sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nosuid <NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address>:/mnt/apps /var/www
```

4. Verify that NFS was mounted successfully by running df -h. Make sure that the changes will persist on Web Server after reboot:

```
sudo vi /etc/fstab
```

add following line

```
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address>:/mnt/apps /var/www nfs defaults 0 0
```

5. Install [Remi’s repository](http://www.servermom.org/how-to-enable-remi-repo-on-centos-7-6-and-5/2790/), Apache and PHP

```
sudo yum install httpd -y

sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

sudo dnf module reset php

sudo dnf module enable php:remi-7.4

sudo dnf install php php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd

sudo systemctl start php-fpm

sudo systemctl enable php-fpm

setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1
```


## Repeat steps 1-5 for another 2 Web Servers.

6. Verify that Apache files and directories are available on the Web Server in /var/www and also on the NFS server in /mnt/apps. 
If you see the same files – it means NFS is mounted correctly. You can try to create a new file touch test.txt from one server and
check if the same file is accessible from other Web Servers.

7. Locate the log folder for Apache on the Web Server and mount it to NFS server’s export for logs. Repeat step №4 to make sure
 the mount point will persist after reboot.

8. Fork the tooling source code from [Darey.io Github Account](https://github.com/darey-io/tooling) to your Github account. (Learn how to fork a repo [here](https://youtu.be/f5grYMXbAV0))

9. Deploy the tooling website’s code to the Webserver. Ensure that the html folder from the repository is deployed to /var/www/html


Note 1: Do not forget to open TCP port 80 on the Web Server.

Note 2: If you encounter 403 Error – check permissions to your /var/www/html folder and also disable SELinux sudo setenforce 0
To make this change permanent – open following config file sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux and set SELINUX=disabledthen restrt httpd.


10. Update the website’s configuration to connect to the database (in /var/www/html/functions.php file). Apply tooling-db.sql script
to your database using this command mysql -h <databse-private-ip> -u <db-username> -p <db-pasword> < tooling-db.sql

11. Create in MySQL a new admin user with username: myuser and password: password:

INSERT INTO ‘users’ (‘id’, ‘username’, ‘password’, ’email’, ‘user_type’, ‘status’) VALUES
-> (1, ‘myuser’, ‘5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99’, ‘user@mail.com’, ‘admin’, ‘1’);

12. Open the website in your browser http://<Web-Server-Public-IP-Address-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php and make sure you can login 
into the websute with myuser user.

Congratulations!
You have just implemented a web solution for a DevOps team using LAMP stack with remote Database and NFS servers
