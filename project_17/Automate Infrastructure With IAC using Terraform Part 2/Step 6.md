# STORAGE AND DATABASE

Useful Terraform Documentation, go through this documentation and understand the arguement needed for each resources:

- [RDS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_subnet_group)
- [EFS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/efs_file_system)
- [KMS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/kms_key)


## Create Elastic File System (EFS)
In order to create an EFS you need to create a [KMS key](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/getting-started/).

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide 
range of AWS services and in your applications.

Add the following code to efs.tf

```
# create key from key management system
resource "aws_kms_key" "ACS-kms" {
  description = "KMS key "
  policy      = <<EOF
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "kms-key-policy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${var.account_no}:user/segun" },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

# create key alias
resource "aws_kms_alias" "alias" {
  name          = "alias/kms"
  target_key_id = aws_kms_key.ACS-kms.key_id
}
```

Let us create EFS and it mount targets- add the following code to efs.tf

```
# create Elastic file system
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "ACS-efs" {
  encrypted  = true
  kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.ACS-kms.arn

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "ACS-efs"
    },
  )
}

# set first mount target for the EFS 
resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "subnet-1" {
  file_system_id  = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private[2].id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.datalayer-sg.id]
}

# set second mount target for the EFS 
resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "subnet-2" {
  file_system_id  = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private[3].id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.datalayer-sg.id]
}

# create access point for wordpress
resource "aws_efs_access_point" "wordpress" {
  file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id

  posix_user {
    gid = 0
    uid = 0
  }

  root_directory {
    path = "/wordpress"

    creation_info {
      owner_gid   = 0
      owner_uid   = 0
      permissions = 0755
    }

  }

}

# create access point for tooling
resource "aws_efs_access_point" "tooling" {
  file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  posix_user {
    gid = 0
    uid = 0
  }

  root_directory {

    path = "/tooling"

    creation_info {
      owner_gid   = 0
      owner_uid   = 0
      permissions = 0755
    }

  }
}
```


Create [MySQL RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html)
Let us create the RDS itself using this snippet of code in rds.tf file:


```
# This section will create the subnet group for the RDS  instance using the private subnet
resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "ACS-rds" {
  name       = "acs-rds"
  subnet_ids = [aws_subnet.private[2].id, aws_subnet.private[3].id]

 tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "ACS-rds"
    },
  )
}

# create the RDS instance with the subnets group
resource "aws_db_instance" "ACS-rds" {
  allocated_storage      = 20
  storage_type           = "gp2"
  engine                 = "mysql"
  engine_version         = "5.7"
  instance_class         = "db.t2.micro"
  name                   = "daviddb"
  username               = var.master-username
  password               = var.master-password
  parameter_group_name   = "default.mysql5.7"
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.ACS-rds.name
  skip_final_snapshot    = true
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.datalayer-sg.id]
  multi_az               = "true"
}
```


Before Applying, if you take note, we gave refrence to a lot of varibales in our resources that has not been declared in the 
variables.tf file. Go through the entire code and spot this variables and declare them in the variables.tf file.

If you have done that well, you file should like this one below.


```
variable "region" {
  type = string
  description = "The region to deploy resources"
}

variable "vpc_cidr" {
  type = string
  description = "The VPC cidr"
}

variable "enable_dns_support" {
  type = bool
}

variable "enable_dns_hostnames" {
  dtype = bool
}

variable "enable_classiclink" {
  type = bool
}

variable "enable_classiclink_dns_support" {
  type = bool
}

variable "preferred_number_of_public_subnets" {
  type        = number
  description = "Number of public subnets"
}

variable "preferred_number_of_private_subnets" {
  type        = number
  description = "Number of private subnets"
}

variable "name" {
  type    = string
  default = "ACS"

}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A mapping of tags to assign to all resources."
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}

variable "ami" {
  type        = string
  description = "AMI ID for the launch template"
}

variable "keypair" {
  type        = string
  description = "key pair for the instances"
}

variable "account_no" {
  type        = number
  description = "the account number"
}

variable "master-username" {
  type        = string
  description = "RDS admin username"
}

variable "master-password" {
  type        = string
  description = "RDS master password"
}
```

Now, we are almost done but we need to update the last file which is terraform.tfvars file. In this file we are going to declare the
values for the variables in our varibales.tf file.

Open the terraform.tfvars file and add the code below

```
region = "us-east-1"

vpc_cidr = "172.16.0.0/16"

enable_dns_support = "true"

enable_dns_hostnames = "true"

enable_classiclink = "false"

enable_classiclink_dns_support = "false"

preferred_number_of_public_subnets = "2"

preferred_number_of_private_subnets = "4"

environment = "production"

ami = "ami-0b0af3577fe5e3532"

keypair = "devops"

# Ensure to change this to your acccount number
account_no = "123456789"

db-username = "david"

db-password = "devopspbl"

tags = {
  Enviroment      = "production" 
  Owner-Email     = "infradev-segun@darey.io"
  Managed-By      = "Terraform"
  Billing-Account = "1234567890"
}
```


At this point, you shall have pretty much all infrastructure elements ready to be deployed automatically, but before we paln and 
apply our code we need to take note of two things;

- we have a long list of files which may looks confusing but that is not bad for a start, we are going to fix this using the concepts 
of modules in Project 18
- Secondly, our application wont work becuase in out shell script that was passed into the launch some endpoints like the RDs and EFS
 point is needed in which they have not been created yet. So in project 19 we will use our Ansible knowledge to fix this.
 
Try to plan and apply your Terraform codes, explore the resources in AWS console and make sure you destroy them right away to avoid
massive costs.

## Additional tasks
In addition to regular project submission include following:

1. Summarise your understanding on Networking concepts like IP Address, Subnets, CIDR Notation, IP Routing, Internet Gateways, NAT
2. Summarise your understanding of the OSI Model, TCP/IP suite and how they are connected – research beyond the provided articles, 
watch different YouTube videos to fully understand the concept around OSI and how it is related to the Internet and end-to-end Web
Solutions. You don not need to memorise the layers – just understand the idea around it.
3. Explain the difference between assume role policy and role policy


**Congratulations!**
Now you have fully automated creation of AWS Infrastructure for 2 websites with Terraform. In the next project we will further
enhance our codes by refactoring and introducing more exciting Terraform concepts! Go ahead and continue your PBL journey!
