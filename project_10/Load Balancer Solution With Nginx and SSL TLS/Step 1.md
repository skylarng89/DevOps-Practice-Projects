CONFIGURE NGINX AS A LOAD BALANCER
You can either uninstall Apache from the existing Load Balancer server, or create a fresh installation of Linux for Nginx.

1. Create an EC2 VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and name it Nginx LB (do not forget to open TCP port 80 for HTTP connections,
 also open TCP port 443 – this port is used for secured HTTPS connections)
2. Update /etc/hosts file for local DNS with Web Servers’ names (e.g. Web1 and Web2) and their local IP addresses
3. Install and configure Nginx as a load balancer to point traffic to the resolvable DNS names of the webservers

Update the instance and Install Nginx

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Configure Nginx LB using Web Servers’ names defined in /etc/hosts

Hint: Read this blog to read about /etc/host

Open the default nginx configuration file

sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf


```
#insert following configuration into http section

 upstream myproject {
    server Web1 weight=5;
    server Web2 weight=5;
  }

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.domain.com;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://myproject;
    }
  }

#comment out this line
#       include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
```


Restart Nginx and make sure the service is up and running


```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
